The following statements are intended as constructive criticism and should be read with the knowledge, that I probably failed in any and all of these points with my own report. I hope these reviews are a bit better and the feedback helpful. :)



# Feedback at Probes by Alex Steiner

The **introduction** covers the core idea well and goes into length about the relatively important context of origin, i.e. situationalism and critique of scientific rationalism. This, I assume, also constitutes the closest thing to a research paradigm of the method; there's no explicit mention otherwise; i'd assume there's probably some overlap with constructivism, though. The introduction names the original authors and cites the seminal paper. It also briefly describes a different flavor: technological probes.

The **"Use"-section** explains the method as well as possible within the confines of this report, in my opinion. It points out the most important challenges and when to use it: early but not without any previous knowledge. It also discusses that by it's very nature/design the data it produces comes more in the form of inspirations, even if there's been (questionable) attempts at formally analyzing it. The same goes for the **"(Dis)advantages"-section**: as far as i can tell, all
important points -- that can be addressed within the confines of this report -- are there.

The dedicated **example-section** is very on-point. However, without looking at the original paper I don't know what the "open-ended activities". Also, it might have been useful to illustrate how the probes had looked like, as aesthetics seem to be a central part of their design. However, the original paper contains (only) two of the children's sketches, which isn't very much either. Then again, I'm a very visual-focussed person and it might not be necessary for others. It's noteworthy, that the other sections already contained examples.

From a **literary style** standpoint the report seems relatively good, concise, very readable, with examples throughout and good lengths of paragraphs and sentences. The **references** are well formatted, hyperlinked (within and without the document) and point to renowned sources: three SIGCHI papers and the original papers that had established the method and the variant.

# Feedback at Digital Ethnography by Carina Pratsch

+ - + sandwich

1. [ ] Introduction
    * [ ] What is the core idea?  
      * isn't it about ethnography in an online setting? tools are important i guess.
      * surveys are digital ethnography?
      * offline photos are still digital ethnography? if they end up online, yeah. think "cooking together" study.
    * [ ] Explain the origins of the method
      - only very briefly, i.e. the "that what people say and what they do can vary significantly" line, that's the argument for any ethnography/observational method.
      - doesn't talk about early reasearchers (or seminal work, if there's any). e.g. that i could find with a quick search. I assume there's others and maybe even earlier practitioners.
      + explains where/why it branched off (i.e. the spread of ICTs)
      - doesn't talk about early struggles of recognition (then again, is it important for this report?)
    * [ ] who proposed it?
      * see above
    * [ ] Are there different flavours or variants? 
      ~ doesn't talk about that. mentions different capturing mechanisms/media (e.g. text, photos, etc) though.
    * [ ] In which paradigm does this method operate? 
      + talks about that. probably meant "qualitative" instead of "quality"
    * [ ] What are the most relevant theories?  
      * ?
-->

The **introduction** gives a good brief summary about the core idea. It talks about the origin of the method in a general sense / how it came about -- i.e. with the application of ethnography to the newly developing ICTs. As a small point of criticism: the description doesn't talk about early/seminal researchers and their publications (e.g. Sandy Stone, Sherry Turkle[-@TurkleLifeScreenIdentity1995], etc) and their research questions, that probably shaped the method and could clarify
the "why?".

Throughout the report different methods of collecting and types of data are mentioned, thus touching upon the various variants / sub-methods that exist under the label "Digital Ethnography". They're also very expressively placed within the interpretivist/constructivist pardigm.

2. [ ] Use 
  * [ ] Explain when to use it and how. 
    + lists major advantages and disadvantages in detail (unobstrusive, during beginning,...)
    ~ talks about blogs, SNs and forums. frames it as "what problems / what community is concerned about" ---- not always a "problem"
    * analysis of preexisting products (better done offline for physical products though?)
  * [ ] What data does it produce?  
    + lists quite a all afaict (pics, audio, video, text; logs, quantitative text analysis?)

3. [ ]  Advantages and Disadvantages Explain what the biggest advantages and disadvantages of this method are 
  * many ppl, global, representative, easy access to insider groups. fast cheap, large volume. 
  ~ without changing their behaviour? with the combination of what types of data? isn't this more about the ability to lurk / having a group that's (semi-)public. in a five person, invite-only discord server a researcher kind of sticks out (unless hiding their intent / doing this without consent)
  * (anonymous-data: missing a sentence there? usually data is not anon. follow up via the same plattform?)
  * talks about ethics :)
  *  follows up with border priv-public = difficult. meant in ctxt of ethics?
-->

The **"Use"-section** lists -- as far as i can tell -- all major advantages and disadvantages, data-sources and types of data it can produce. This also applies to the **"Advantages and Disadvantages"-section**. My only point there would be, that the advantage of observing without changing peoples behavior probably depends more on how large and (semi-)public a group is (e.g. on a five-person, invite-only chat server additional people stick out). I'm not sure how the original
argument about the 'combination of different types of data' was meant, though.

<!--
4. [ ]  Example Provide a short example from the literature
  * good example. probably also known to most course members as one of the papers we had to read. illustrates unobstrusiveness.
  * pictures / coding-example would have been helpful to illustrate even further (even if potentially beyond scope)
-->

The **example** relatively well chose, also because many of us should be already familiar with it, as it was one of the papers in the reading-assignment list. One or two figures of some of the collected data and the coding from the original paper would have been helpful for people who haven't read that.


<!--
1. readability
  - >100 char line-length/column-width  (a good measure is 45-90 characters, ideally closer to 45. easily measurable by typing out the alphabet)  hard to fit on smaller screens. easy to lose line with eyes.
1. style
  - recommend spellchecker. not many grammatical errors but some that could have been automatically caught.
1. good citations?
  * good style
  * not really a big thing / {maybe just drop}: could be hyperlinked within - - and where applicable - - without) the document. i've got a workflow for that now with zotero + ff-plugin + better-bibtex plugin + csl-export + markdown build with pandoc. there's easier ones though (it's more a convienience thing for me and i'm thankful to alex steiner for the pointer).
1. ethics
  * talks about them
-->

About **style**: The text is well readable. I'd only recommend two minor changes: Firstly, to reduce the line-length to well below a hundred characters -- [@MatthewLinelength] recommends 45-90 -- to help people with jumping to the next line and make reading on smaller screens manageable. And secondly, to run a spellchecker (e.g. language-tool^[<https://languagetool.org/>]) on the text to catch some of the grammar errors. Anyway, it wasn't a huge problem as sentences had a good length and the language was clear and approachable enough.

The **references** are well formatted and -- as far as i can tell -- to authoritative authors and works.

This report is really well done overall. It starts off with a concise definition of the core idea, explains the purpose,  when and how to use it as well as advantages and disadvantages of doing so -- all with good references and examples throughout. 

The same also goes for why and how the method came about in the social sciences, however as a minor point, it doesn't mention seminal or early practitioners or works by name, such as -- as far as i can tell with a quick search -- [@doi:10.17730/humo.38.1.u761n5601t4g318v] and [@AMAN:AMAN14049]. The explanation does well without them though as it stays on a more general level and still talks about the motivations and the context of its conception.

The report argues well why the method is part of its paradigm (i.e. constructivist/interpretivist). The dedicated/larger example it gives is described down to a particular observation. 

The only two moderate issues i can really find are stylistic: I noticed that the author's name is missing from the report. Also, the line-length is rather long at over a hundred characters making it harder to read on small screens and more likely to lose the line while moving down (the latter of which is somewhat off-set by the good line-spacing/leading). Usually it's recommended -- e.g. by [@MatthewLinelength] -- to stay between 45 and 90 characters; preferably towards the lower end of that range. 

The language and writing style of the report are very concise, on-point but still approachable and clear. 

There's a large number of references, and they're well formatted as far as i can tell many of them from authoritative conferences, publishers and authors.
