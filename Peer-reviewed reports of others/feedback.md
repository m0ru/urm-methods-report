# Probes by Alex Steiner

The **introduction** covers the core idea well and goes into length about the relatively important context of origin, i.e. situationalism and critique of scientific rationalism. This, I assume, also constitutes the closest thing to a research paradigm of the method; there's no explicit mention otherwise; i'd assume there's probably some overlap with constructivism, though. The introduction names the original authors and cites the founding paper. It also briefly describes a different flavor: technological probes.

The **"Use"-section** explains the method as well as possible within the confines of this report, in my opinion. It points out the most important challenges and when to use it: early but not without any previous knowledge. It also discusses that by it's very nature/design the data it produces comes more in the form of inspirations, even if there's been (questionable) attempts at formally analyzing it. The same goes for the **"(Dis)advantages"-section**: as far as i can tell, all
important points -- that can be addressed within the confines of this report -- are there.

The dedicated **example-section** is very on-point. However, without looking at the original paper I don't know what the "open-ended activities". Also, it might have been useful to illustrate how the probes had looked like. However, the original paper contains two sketches by children, which isn't very much either. Then again, I'm a very visual-focussed person and it might not be necessary for others. It's noteworthy, that the other sections already contained examples.

From a **literary style** standpoint the report seems relatively good, concise, very readable, with examples throughout and good lengths of paragraphs and sentences. The **references** are well done and point to renowned sources: three SIGCHI papers and the original papers that had established the method and the variant.

1. [ ] Introduction
    * [x] What is the core idea?  
      * even goes into fine details of importance (e.g. the focus it has)
    * [x] Explain the origins of the method
      * goes into good level of detail / approaches introduction with this as main focus, explains original purpose
    * [x] who proposed it? 
      * Gaver
    * [x] Are there different flavours or variants? 
      * tech probes by hutchinson
    * [?] In which paradigm does this method operate? 
      * situationalists? does explain focus and assumptions though. not easy to classify (though i assume, among the ones we talked about so far: constructivist). eschews analysis alltogether.
    * [?] What are the most relevant theories?  
2. [ ]  Use 
  * [x] Explain when to use it and how. 
    * early in process but not without prior knw
  * [x] What data does it produce?  
    * open discussion
    * inspirational material, possible but shouldn't be analyzed (as that beats original purpose and criticism)
3. [x]  Advantages and Disadvantages Explain what the biggest advantages and disadvantages of this method are 
  * gentle, self-reflection, giving something back, aesthetics
  * can't be (easily) analyzed
  * requires design-skill
  * cost for tech probes
4. [ ]  Example Provide a short example from the literature
  - picture of a probe would have been nice (e.g. example mentions drawings)
    * figure in original paper wasn't too high-res though ^^"
  - which open ended activities?
  + concise and clear otherwise
1. good citations: yes!
1. readability: yep
1. literaric style
  * examples throughout
  * good length of paragraphs
  * concise
