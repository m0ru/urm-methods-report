# Probes by Alex Steiner

The **introduction** covers the core idea well and goes into length about the relatively important context of origin, i.e. situationalism and critique of scientific rationalism. This, I assume, also constitutes the closest thing to a research paradigm of the method; there's no explicit mention otherwise; i'd assume there's probably some overlap with constructivism, though. The introduction names the original authors and cites the founding paper. It also briefly describes a different flavor: technological probes.

The **"Use"-section** explains the method as well as possible within the confines of this report, in my opinion. It points out the most important challenges and when to use it: early but not without any previous knowledge. It also discusses that by it's very nature/design the data it produces comes more in the form of inspirations, even if there's been (questionable) attempts at formally analyzing it. The same goes for the **"(Dis)advantages"-section**: as far as i can tell, all
important points -- that can be addressed within the confines of this report -- are there.

The dedicated **example-section** is very on-point. However, without looking at the original paper I don't know what the "open-ended activities". Also, it might have been useful to illustrate how the probes had looked like, as aesthetics seem to be a central part of their design. However, the original paper contains (only) two of the children's sketches, which isn't very much either. Then again, I'm a very visual-focussed person and it might not be necessary for others. It's noteworthy, that the other sections already contained examples.

From a **literary style** standpoint the report seems relatively good, concise, very readable, with examples throughout and good lengths of paragraphs and sentences. The **references** are well done and point to renowned sources: three SIGCHI papers and the original papers that had established the method and the variant.

1. [ ] Introduction
    * [x] What is the core idea?  
      * even goes into fine details of importance (e.g. the focus it has)
    * [x] Explain the origins of the method
      * goes into good level of detail / approaches introduction with this as main focus, explains original purpose
    * [x] who proposed it? 
      * Gaver
    * [x] Are there different flavours or variants? 
      * tech probes by hutchinson
    * [?] In which paradigm does this method operate? 
      * situationalists? does explain focus and assumptions though. not easy to classify (though i assume, among the ones we talked about so far: constructivist). eschews analysis alltogether.
    * [?] What are the most relevant theories?  
2. [ ]  Use 
  * [x] Explain when to use it and how. 
    * early in process but not without prior knw
  * [x] What data does it produce?  
    * open discussion
    * inspirational material, possible but shouldn't be analyzed (as that beats original purpose and criticism)
3. [x]  Advantages and Disadvantages Explain what the biggest advantages and disadvantages of this method are 
  * gentle, self-reflection, giving something back, aesthetics
  * can't be (easily) analyzed
  * requires design-skill
  * cost for tech probes
4. [ ]  Example Provide a short example from the literature
  - picture of a probe would have been nice (e.g. example mentions drawings)
    * figure in original paper wasn't too high-res though ^^"
  - which open ended activities?
  + concise and clear otherwise
1. good citations: yes!
1. readability: yep
1. literaric style
  * examples throughout
  * good length of paragraphs
  * concise
