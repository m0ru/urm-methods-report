ich schreibs auch für meine peers :P
 also hab beschlossen der sinn davon ist
 leuten ein gefühl dafür zu geben wann sie mehr papers lesen sollten
 aka wann die methode hilfreich ist, was es für skills braucht, whatever
 mit einem sehr deutlichen "seids keine doofen zahlenfetischisten" unterton
 kontext der entstehung ist bei mir auch sehr wichtig, das ist bei "group methods" vielleicht bissi schwierig :P

Disclaimer: I've been being sick for the last two days (and still am) and pretty overworked before that with other courses, wage-labor and critical tasks in side-projects, which is also the reason why I'd broken down and become sick in the first place. As such this report has been written while exhausted and over the span of a few hours and suffered accordingly in quality. :|  The largest parts of this report will be from my personal experience in participating in these formats  with only a few references (of suboptimal quality) as I haven't had the time to
do proper literature research for the six <!-- TODO!!! correct if less --> methods described below. This isn't intended as an excuse, but as a fair word of warning (don't trust this report as a source too much) and as a bit of contextual information so as to not leave you wondering "what the hell was up with this author?!" ^^

With that out of the way and without further ado: Group Techniques.  
As this is more a category of loosely connected methods formulated for very different reaons in different situations, I'll go over <!--TODO (some of) --> the ones mentioned in the lecture slides one by one and then try to point out connections and similarities in the discussion section <!-- TODO!!!! did i actually do that? -->. The methods are as follows:

* Focus Groups 
* Fishbowl 
* Bar Camp 
* World Cafe 
* Breakout Sessions 
* Open Space (Technology)


# Focus Groups 

[![focus group](figures/focus_group.jpg){ height=200px }](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Focus_Groups,_National_Network_Meetings,_GINKS_IMG_3920_\(5348319263\).jpg)

The idea is to recruit a small group (e.g. 6-12) of people from the target demographic/roles, usually in a lab setting, give them a question and let them discuss it with only minimal moderating. Alternatively researchers can give them an exercise to follow, e.g. role-playing, drawing, or ranking, sorting, grouping and/or collaging items, text snippets and pictures. Usually the sessions are audio/video-recorded (which suggests the lab setting) and notes are taken by the moderator or a seperate
observer. All of this resulting data can later be analyzed and (as most group methods) will inform about memories  of experiences (colored by the recall process however), mental models, lingo, and in particular and contrast to single-person interviews: about social dynamics in the group. 

Note, that some of the former only come up due to the presence of multiple people which remind each other about things they wouldn't have thought of in a single-person interview; that are collective memory. The social (power) dynamic between
participants and the effect of an intimidating lab setting (presence of recording equip and authoritative researcher) might also mean that some statements are self-censored and/or some participants might not get to speak much. 

<!-- TODO move to general section -->
Due to the setup it's also not suited to directly study dynamics in larger groups on it's own (the other group methods, e.g. barcamps and world-cafes are better suited for those sizes). It's also inherently qualitative and best suited for studies in the constructivist (and potentiall critical theory) paradigma(s).

Note, that with some reduction in quality, these can also be held online using video-chat and online collaboration tools (for exercises)

The method, then named "Group Studies" was discovered/invented in 1946 by Robert Merton who was studying the effects of propaganda (in particular radio broadcasts, army training and morale films) at the US Bureau of Applied Social Research at the Columbia University. It was later picked up and further developed by the Viennese psychologist and marketer Ernest Dichter who was heavily influenced and had studied under Sigmund Freud, who before his death also gave it the name "Focus
Groups". Dichter's goal was to study the subconscious cravings influencing buying decisions by reading between the lines of what people talked about in the focus groups. Campaigns he worked on included for example the Chrysler Plymouth convertible (with the result to market it as "home product" to wifes so they wouldn't stop their husbands from buying a cabriolet) and the Barbie Doll (that should give girls a future self to associate with, with the very Freudian twist that
it's all about sex and sex appeal). The method fell out of favor with the rise of computer based analysis and decline of Freudianism, but later rediscovered and is widely used in qualitative market research.

# Fishbowl 

[![fishbowl seating arrangment -- inner and outer circles](figures/fishbowl_diagram.png){  height=250px }](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Fishbowl_diagram_172.png)

<!-- 

## Introduction
### What is the core idea?  

discussion structure for larger groups by having a few highly visible, constantly rotating people discussing in the inner circle of chairs.

smaller circle of chairs for discutants in center (e.g. 5-8), larger circle around that. usually an expert starts in the center to kick off the discussion on a given topic. people can switch to a free chair in the inner circle when they want to say something. once they've replied to any follow-up questions or -discussion-strands they move back to the outer circle (same goes for the initial expert). This allows people to sit back and observe when they don't want to talk at the moment. It
also has the effect that people have time to think about points they want to make before / while moving into the inner circle. 

also discussing in really large groups / anonymous masses rarely works well (from my own experience). something about the social dynamic. fishbowl keeps inner circle small.

medium sized groups. walking to and joining the inner circle needs to stay feasible.


### Explain the origins of the method, who proposed it? 

{ TODO }

### Are there different flavours or variants? 

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishbowl_(conversation)>

open fishbowl (the one described above)
only two chairs, audience member taps should of speaker to replace them
full exchange of inner circle after set intervalls/when discussion runs out

time limits 
intervalls at which outer circle is asked for input instead of inner circle

### In which paradigm does this method operate? 

constructivist if used similar to a focus group to elaborate on personal experiences and discuss mental models but can also be critical theory in the sense that an action plan is formulated (even though world cafe/breakaway/barcamp/openspace+reporting probably deals better as finer points/sub-topics can be better discussed and more people have a chance to contribute due to the smaller effective group sizes / less anxiety about speaking in front of larger groups)

### What are the most relevant theories?  

huh?

##  Use: 
### Explain when to use it and how. 

how: see/merge with idea

when: 

* want to tap knowledge/points of view/mental models of large group on an issue while giving people a place to retreat/just watch
* collective memory (see focus groups)

when not: if you want to have every persons opinion in the room. some people won't talk (and that's 'k)

also see focus groups

## Introduction
### What is the core idea?  

discuss a complicated issue, usually with the goal of coming up with an action plan. a large focus is on providing a inviting, casual, cafe-like ambience. there's multiple tables e.g. one per sub-topic, covered in paper (so they can be written upon) and a person staying there. the rest of the people switch through. the person who stayed behind gives an overview of the discussion on the table so far. the paper allows participants to leave messages in their own words and drawings.
usually the table hosts will report back to the larger plenum at the end. there might also be an introductionary talk at the start.

works at varying sizes

### Explain the origins of the method, who proposed it? 

<http://www.theworldcafe.com/about-us/history/>

1995 meeting of business persons and academics the home of Juanita Brown and David Isaacs in California. plan for large-circle meeting was disrupted by rain and they split up. recording insights on makeshift tablecloths.

### Are there different flavours or variants? 

one without reporting back (focus on discussion not outcomes)

### In which paradigm does this method operate? 

constructivist (understanding mental models of larger group) / critical theory (action plan)
### What are the most relevant theories?  

##  Use: 
### Explain when to use it and how. 
### What data does it produce?  

recordings of reporting back (if any), notes on tables

##  Advantages and Disadvantages: Explain what the biggest advantages and disadvantages of this method are 

very inclusive due to small table sizes and effort made to set ambience (if done right; easy to do wrong)

good for complex issues: small size makes discussions productive but due to rotation knw of entire crowd is tapped

good deliberate for making collective action plans in a larger group

same as all group methods: collaborative knw, etc

important to set ambience and have diverse crowd!

# Bar Camp 


[![sessionplan of barcamp graz 2017](figures/barcamp_whiteboard.jpg){ height=200px }](http://barcamp-graz.at/2017/04/so-schaut-der-sessionplan-vom-ersten-barcamp-tag-aus/)

<!-- 

## Introduction
### What is the core idea?  

unconference. reaction/critique/subversion of large conferences with fixed session plan and minimal interactivity

can have overarching themes (uxcamp, suggested tracks in barcamp graz) but otherwise is rather free

strong sense of contribution. e.g. "if this is your first barcamp, you have to hold a session."

large numbers of people (it's an (un)conference). individual session vary in size depending on style and number of people interested in it.


### Explain the origins of the method, who proposed it? 

was open-to-public alternative to invitation-only [foocamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foo_Camp) hosted by the hackerTim O'Reilly that already had a similar format and arose as an idea to use vacant office space in 2003 (and that also had a foo bar for drinks).

### Are there different flavours or variants? 

e.g. hybrid with regular conference (e.g. uxcamp with one fixed track / skeleton session plan and one free track/free slots all through the day that use the barcamp mode. allows people to choose style and thus usually also interactivity and group size. allows last minute submissions. allows room for discussion without fully abandoning pre-planned talk by experts)

### In which paradigm does this method operate? 

critical theory?
is a critique / method aimed at breaking up rigid conference structures. can be used to discuss issues / make action plans in different time-slots. about knw and experience transfer between particpants.

### What are the most relevant theories?  

?

##  Use: 
### Explain when to use it and how. 

as it's an (un)conference format you need to have at least one, ideally several rooms (with different, rearrangable seating arrangments and ambiences suited for different session-types), (probably) registration and ideally catering, after hours activities, etc

planning session^[barcamp graz 2017 - video of (sparsely attended) planning session on sunday: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF4y63whodg>] every morning. people write topics of sessions on pieces of paper, and e.g. assign them to time slots and rooms on a (moveable) corkboard = physical session plan. usually there's also digital variant for ease of access if you're somewhere else in the building (then again the physical thing is good place to get into conversations with people)

sessions can be anything, e.g. talks, discussions, hands-on workshops, leisure time (barcamp graz 2017 had a floor excercise and a board-games session)

good to meet people from all possible (sub-)fields (related to the main field if any; e.g. *ux*camp vs completely open @ graz)

individual session can be used by participants as plattform to get and give feedback / discussion of projects/issues they're researching in a way similar to any of the other group techniques. it's more about equal sharing and contributing though.

### What data does it produce?  

not intended as data collection method but as forum

audio-/video-recordings (unusual), transcripts, notes, posters (rare but possible), tweets, follow-up contacts,... (especially if running a discussion 


more knw for participants

##  Advantages and Disadvantages: Explain what the biggest advantages and disadvantages of this method are

# Open Space (Technology)

[![open space plenary circle](figures/open_space_plenum.jpg){ height=200px }](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:NASA_Open_Space_2_Innovate.jpg)
<!-- 

## Introduction
### What is the core idea?  

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology>

<http://www.chriscorrigan.com/openspace/whatisos.html>

let people organize own conference/meeting with very fluent seating setup (main plenary circle and many breakaway circles) and participants moving between discussion groups at any point.

minimal managment

invitation gives purpose of meeting. first 30-90 mins are about setting agenda (~barcamp). bulletin board with issues/mapping to smaller seating-circles. if you come up with a new sub-issue post a new entry there.

less conferency / more something for one large room / more of a meeting format

large plenary seating circle and smaller subcircles/breakout-sessions for sub-issues/topics. people can move around as they want ("marketplace" where people "shop" for ideas)

full process:

* Opening Circle (agenda co-creation process at the start, without the facilitator helping / synthesizing / suggesting / reducing topics)
* Facilitator’s explanation of principles and law (calling them guidelines, invitations, whatever)
* Multiple conversations ideally happening around the same big space, ideally several discussion sessions across time (without the facilitator helping those groups)
* Closing Circle (comment and reflection)

persons who started breakouts are responsible for starting discussion there, taking notes and reporting back.

notes are collected as proceedings and sent to everyone

similarities to barcamp (@agenda), world-cafe (multiple discussion groups and people moving, reporting back; no paper and ambience setting per default though) and breakaway-sessions (split and then reporting back). 


Guiding principles:

* Whoever comes is the right people 
* Whenever it starts is the right time 
* Wherever it is, is the right place 
* Whatever happens is the only thing that could have, be prepared to be surprised! 
* When it's over, it's over (within this session) 

Roles: Bird (person starting breakaway/nest), Bee (stay with one breakaway) <-> Butterflies (people moving in between, carrying ideas across)

Owen's Law of two feet: "If at any time during our time together you find yourself in any situation where you are neither learning nor contributing, use your two feet, go someplace else."

### Explain the origins of the method, who proposed it? 

guy {TODO} was organizing conferences on organisatorial managment. first two were classic conferences with large managment overhead. over a glass of martini had the idea to give people space and let them organize their own conference. (similar to a barcamp in that manner)

the "technology" in open space technology comes from a person {TODO} speaking in front of the media. sounded more impressive. got picked up the news.

clear origin in business/managment/workshop-culture


### Are there different flavours or variants? 

{TODO}

### In which paradigm does this method operate? 

critical theory(?) as point is to come up with whatever the particpants want to (e.g. an action plan)


### What are the most relevant theories?  



##  Use: 
### Explain when to use it and how. 

@how: see "core"

when: harrison owen^[Owen, Harrison (2008). Open Space Technology: A User's Guide (3rd ed.). Berrett-Koehler. ISBN 978-1-57675-476-4.] writes it works well for issues that require/have high complexity, diversity, conflict (real or potential) and urgency. 

don't use it next steps are clear, leaders/sponsors already know answers and just want to sell them, organization is preferred to be top-down by managment, etc

challenge: facilitator should be present but invisible. logistics, managing space

### What data does it produce?  

notes/proceedings

##  Advantages and Disadvantages: Explain what the biggest advantages and disadvantages of this method are 

see when
