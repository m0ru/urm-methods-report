ich schreibs auch für meine peers :P
 also hab beschlossen der sinn davon ist
 leuten ein gefühl dafür zu geben wann sie mehr papers lesen sollten
 aka wann die methode hilfreich ist, was es für skills braucht, whatever
 mit einem sehr deutlichen "seids keine doofen zahlenfetischisten" unterton
 kontext der entstehung ist bei mir auch sehr wichtig, das ist bei "group methods" vielleicht bissi schwierig :P

Group Techniques in general:

{TODO} did they influence each other and if so how?

Disclaimer: I've been being sick for the last two days (and still am) and pretty overworked before that with other courses, wage-labor and critical tasks in side-projects, which is also the reason why I'd broken down and become sick in the first place. As such this report has been written while exhausted and over the span of a few hours and suffered accordingly in quality. :|  The largest parts of this report will be from my personal experience in participating in these formats  with only a few references (of suboptimal quality) as I haven't had the time to
do proper literature research for the six <!-- TODO!!! correct if less --> methods described below. This isn't intended as an excuse, but as a fair word of warning (don't trust this report as a source too much) and as a bit of contextual information so as to not leave you wondering "what the hell was up with this author?!" ^^

With that out of the way and without further ado: Group Techniques.  
As this is more a category of loosely connected methods formulated for very different reaons in different situations, I'll go over <!--TODO (some of) --> the ones mentioned in the lecture slides one by one and then try to point out connections and similarities in the discussion section <!-- TODO!!!! did i actually do that? -->. The methods are as follows:

* Focus Groups 
* Fishbowl 
* Bar Camp 
* World Cafe 
* Breakout Sessions 
* Open Space (Technology)


# Focus Groups 


<!-- 
<https://www.nngroup.com/articles/focus-groups/>

## Introduction

### What is the core idea?  

get a bunch of people together (classically in a lab), give them a question, let them talk with only minimal moderating. takes notes/audio/video for later analysis.

The Use and Misuse of Focus Groups https://www.nngroup.com/articles/focus-groups/
not for behaviour, usability, etc but to discover what users want.

small groups



### Explain the origins of the method, who proposed it? 

wikipedia mentions them being used to test effectiveness of propaganda during WWII by sociologist R.K.Merton the "father of the focus groups". term coined by ernest dichter. before "focused interviews" / "group depth interviews" / 

<http://blog.qsample.com/freud-and-the-intriguing-origins-of-the-focus-group/>: 

* Robert Merton in 1946 at the US Bureau of Applied Social Research at Columbia University. studies on effects of radio broadcasts, army training and morale films (and thus effectiveness of propaganda). "group studies"
* viennese psychologist / marketer ernest dichter. studied under freud. " people’s shopping cravings were hidden like an iceberg below an ocean of the subconscious. Only through interaction and insight could a researcher decipher the true longing and concerns of consumers;" + "sexual cravings, parent issues, archetypical social fears, etc". "let people talk and read between lines what they really mean". focus groups as method of preference/choice. called it "motivational research". recommended body proportions of barbie. "soul" (branding) of product.
* fell out of favour in 60s for quantitative, computer-friendly methods. also decline of freudianism.
* comeback as qualitative market research.
* fgroups can be done online by now at the cost of a strong bias in who can easily participate and loss of interaction quality. f2f still best.

{TODO}: how where they geared towards propaganda-studies? how would early group studies / group depth interviews look like? what were the design decisions?

### Are there different flavours or variants? 

{i assume merton's and dichters variants differed. how did they change to today?}

### In which paradigm does this method operate? 

i'd say constructivist. as it tries to capture peoples experiences/mental models respectively the ones constructed in the focusgroup

### What are the most relevant theories?  

huh?

##  Use: 
### Explain when to use it and how. 

{not from ref}: discover internal worlds, social dynamics, remember more together

when not to use it: if you want to study behaviour or want to run large, quantitative experiments.

### What data does it produce?  

audio-/video-recordings, transcripts, notes, posters, ?

##  Advantages and Disadvantages: Explain what the biggest advantages and disadvantages of this method are 

compared to non-group techniques: 

* can capture social dynamics. 
* social dynamics can mean that some group members dominate the discussion or that some things aren't shared before others.
* collective memory / recall. people reminding each other of other things they know

compared to other group techniques:

{ TODO }
* some are more conference/meeting formats for transfering knw / making an action plan (?)

compared to quantitative methods and observations: get insight into internal models

General Challenges (from slides):

* Logistics - more people, more constraints 
* Managing Space 
* Moderation

## Example

Provide a short example from the literature 

marketing: shape of barbie, cars,...

{TODO sthg more modern?}

# Fishbowl 

[![fishbowl seating arrangment -- inner and outer circles](figures/fishbowl_diagram.png){  height=300px }](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Fishbowl_diagram_172.png)

<!-- 

## Introduction
### What is the core idea?  

discussion structure for larger groups by having a few highly visible, constantly rotating people discussing in the inner circle of chairs.

smaller circle of chairs for discutants in center (e.g. 5-8), larger circle around that. usually an expert starts in the center to kick off the discussion on a given topic. people can switch to a free chair in the inner circle when they want to say something. once they've replied to any follow-up questions or -discussion-strands they move back to the outer circle (same goes for the initial expert). This allows people to sit back and observe when they don't want to talk at the moment. It
also has the effect that people have time to think about points they want to make before / while moving into the inner circle. 

also discussing in really large groups / anonymous masses rarely works well (from my own experience). something about the social dynamic. fishbowl keeps inner circle small.

medium sized groups. walking to and joining the inner circle needs to stay feasible.


### Explain the origins of the method, who proposed it? 

{ TODO }

### Are there different flavours or variants? 

{ TODO }

### In which paradigm does this method operate? 

constructivist if used similar to a focus group to elaborate on personal experiences and discuss mental models but can also be critical theory in the sense that an action plan is formulated (even though world cafe/breakaway/barcamp/openspace+reporting probably deals better as finer points/sub-topics can be better discussed and more people have a chance to contribute due to the smaller effective group sizes / less anxiety about speaking in front of larger groups)

### What are the most relevant theories?  

huh?

##  Use: 
### Explain when to use it and how. 

how: see/merge with idea

when: 

* want to tap knowledge/points of view/mental models of large group on an issue while giving people a place to retreat/just watch
* collective memory (see focus groups)

when not: if you want to have every persons opinion in the room. some people won't talk (and that's 'k)

also see focus groups 

{TODO 

### What data does it produce?  

audio-/video-recordings, transcripts, notes

##  Advantages and Disadvantages: Explain what the biggest advantages and disadvantages of this method are 

General Challenges (from slides):

* Logistics - more people, more constraints 
* Managing Space 
* Moderation

## Example

{TODO} Provide a short example from the literature 

fishbowl we did on self-driving cars? the one(s) at klausur?

# Bar Camp 


[![sessionplan of barcamp graz 2017](figures/barcamp_whiteboard.jpg)](http://barcamp-graz.at/2017/04/so-schaut-der-sessionplan-vom-ersten-barcamp-tag-aus/)

<!-- 

## Introduction
### What is the core idea?  

unconference. reaction/critique/subversion of large conferences with fixed session plan and minimal interactivity

can have overarching themes (uxcamp, suggested tracks in barcamp graz) but otherwise is rather free

strong sense of contribution. e.g. "if this is your first barcamp, you have to hold a session."

large numbers of people (it's an (un)conference). individual session vary in size depending on style and number of people interested in it.


### Explain the origins of the method, who proposed it? 

{TODO}

### Are there different flavours or variants? 

{TODO}
hybrid with regular conference (e.g. uxcamp with one fixed track / skeleton session plan and one free track/free slots all through the day that use the barcamp mode. allows people to choose style and thus usually also interactivity and group size. allows last minute submissions. allows room for discussion without fully abandoning pre-planned talk by experts)

### In which paradigm does this method operate? 

critical theory?
is a critique / method aimed at breaking up rigid conference structures. can be used to discuss issues / make action plans in different time-slots. about knw and experience transfer between particpants.

### What are the most relevant theories?  

?

##  Use: 
### Explain when to use it and how. 

as it's an (un)conference format you need to have at least one, ideally several rooms (with different, rearrangable seating arrangments and ambiences suited for different session-types), (probably) registration and ideally catering, after hours activities, etc

planning session^[barcamp graz 2017 - video of (sparsely attended) planning session on sunday: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IF4y63whodg>] every morning. people write topics of sessions on pieces of paper, and e.g. assign them to time slots and rooms on a (moveable) corkboard = physical session plan. usually there's also digital variant for ease of access if you're somewhere else in the building (then again the physical thing is good place to get into conversations with people)

sessions can be anything, e.g. talks, discussions, hands-on workshops, leisure time (barcamp graz 2017 had a floor excercise and a board-games session)

good to meet people from all possible (sub-)fields (related to the main field if any; e.g. *ux*camp vs completely open @ graz)

individual session can be used by participants as plattform to get and give feedback / discussion of projects/issues they're researching in a way similar to any of the other group techniques. it's more about equal sharing and contributing though.

### What data does it produce?  

not intended as data collection method but as forum

audio-/video-recordings (unusual), transcripts, notes, posters (rare but possible), tweets, follow-up contacts,... (especially if running a discussion 


more knw for participants

##  Advantages and Disadvantages: Explain what the biggest advantages and disadvantages of this method are 

see when and how

General Challenges (from slides):

* Logistics - more people, more constraints 
* Managing Space 
* Moderation
