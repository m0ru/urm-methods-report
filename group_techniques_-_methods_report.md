Each report should contain the following sections: 

1.  Introduction: What is the core idea?  Explain the origins of the method, who proposed it? Are there different flavours or variants? In which paradigm does this method operate? What are the most relevant theories?  
2.  Use: Explain when to use it and how. What data does it produce?  
3.  Advantages and Disadvantages: Explain what the biggest advantages and disadvantages of this method are 
4.  Example: Provide a short example from the literature 

Note: You can deviate from this structure as long as all relevant points are discussed.

ich schreibs auch f端r meine peers :P
 also hab beschlossen der sinn davon ist
 leuten ein gef端hl daf端r zu geben wann sie mehr papers lesen sollten
 aka wann die methode hilfreich ist, was es f端r skills braucht, whatever
 mit einem sehr deutlichen "seids keine doofen zahlenfetischisten" unterton
 kontext der entstehung ist bei mir auch sehr wichtig, das ist bei "group methods" vielleicht bissi schwierig :P
